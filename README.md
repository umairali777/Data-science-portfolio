# Machine learning

(1) https://github.com/umairali777/Data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Cancer_gene_expression_classification_with_support_vector_machine.ipynb : IN this project i have use leukemia cancer gene expression dataset where i have 7129 features with 72 samples of cancer patients and two classes AML, ALL, i have used PCA an unsupervised technique for dimension reduction  and for better visualization of best features with high variance then i used suport vector machine classifier  which is a  supervised machine learning model with svm model i got 91.2 accuracy, it could be imporved with some preprocessing and tuning.




# Exploratory data analysis with visualization
(1) https://github.com/umairali777/Data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Sales_analysis.ipynb :  i have used 12 months of sales data  with 186849 samples with 6 features  order id, product,quantity ordered,price,date,address with 12 csv files, first of all i merge all files in one master file with the help of globe package then i done some exploratory data analysis to answer some important questions.
